# Float Text Movement, with UI

This is a UI version of Float Text Movement script. It adds a easy-to-use UI, additionly optimized some features of the original script:

- Bundled into an .exe version, so that you don't have to install Python to use.
- Exposed more generation options from the original script, such as text size.
- Restricting inputs to avoid wrong output.

Original version credits @Shareoff (**Shareoff#2107**).
